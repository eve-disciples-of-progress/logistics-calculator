[Someone](https://github.com/mickdekkers) has been kind enough to map eves universe and put it in a neat JSON.
It can be found [here](https://github.com/mickdekkers/eve-map-json). Its copy is [here](https://github.com/eve-disciples-of-progress/logistics-calculator/blob/master/rawData.js).
Run [`transform.js`](https://github.com/eve-disciples-of-progress/logistics-calculator/blob/master/transform.js) via [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) to convert it in to a format usable by the calculator.
This will overwrite [`systems.js`](https://github.com/eve-disciples-of-progress/logistics-calculator/blob/master/systems.js).
